# Fingerprint Detection Program

This Python program uses the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm to find matching keypoints and descriptors between a query fingerprint image and a set of fingerprint images. It then calculates a score to identify the best match in the given dataset of fingerprint images.

## Dependencies

- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install the patool library to extract the fingerprint image dataset from an archive.
